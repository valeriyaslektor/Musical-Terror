# ðŸ›  Optimal Engine for Concept Implementation: Unity

## Why Unity?

1. **Relative Complexity** â€“ Over the years, Unityâ€™s learning curve has lowered. There are numerous free tutorials on YouTube, articles, and Unity Learn resources. Additionally, I have taken a Unity development course on Skillbox.

2. **Optimized for 2D** â€“ Unity is better suited for **2D game development** than Unreal Engine. It also allows for **multi-platform development**, supporting both **PC and mobile devices**, which was part of the original concept vision.

3. **Stability** â€“ Unity has been in use longer and is more popular. Bugs and technical issues are encountered less frequently, plus it offers easily accessible technical support.

4. **Budget & Accessibility** â€“ Unity Personal is free for individual developers and small teams with revenue or funding **below $100,000 per year**, making it a viable option for this project.

5. **2D Capabilities** â€“ Compared to other 2D engines like **GameMaker** or **Defold**, Unity offers **more flexibility and interactions**. Since the game requires mechanics such as dragging, moving, and object interactions within a **2D world**, Unity is the best fit.

## ðŸŽ¨ Graphics & Concept Style

### **1. Daytime: Playing the Piano**

To create the effect of a "normal" world, the environment should feel **cozy and well-lit**. Objects in the room should be clearly visible, helping to tell the protagonistâ€™s story. Small details, such as **empty food containers, a pack of chips, or an unfinished coffee**, reflect the characterâ€™s isolated lifestyle. However, this setting should not induce uneaseâ€”at least not in the first level.

In the game, instead of a **computer screen**, the **piano** will be the primary interactive object. Players can switch between a **full-room view** and a **close-up of the piano** by clicking on it.

### **How This Affects UX?**

- The more the player leans toward **bad choices**, the more the **environment starts to distort**. 
- Trees outside the window will transform into **claw-like branches**.
- Chips will become **eyes staring into the soul**.
- A **dark shadow** will appear at the corner of the bed.

These subtle horror elements **immerse the player** in the protagonistâ€™s psychological state. This not only impacts the **narrative** but also affects **gameplay** â€“ allowing players to recognize changes and reconsider their choices.

## **2. Sleep Paralysis: The Monsters**

Since the game has an **artistic visual style**, the monsters should look like **nightmare creatures** â€“ horrifying yet surreal. 

I envision **black, shadowy beings** with **no distinct shapes**, but with **sharp accents** like glowing **eyes, claws, and fangs**â€”elements that represent **a real threat to the protagonist's life**.

### **How This Affects UX?**
- The **horror experience** intensifies as the player struggles to sleep. 
- Demons are **invisible at first**, hidden in the shadows.
- As the nightmare progresses, **they emerge and approach**.
- With **each level**, the **timer increases**, tension builds, and the sound design becomes more oppressive (ringing ears, heavy breathing, demonic laughter).
- If the player makes **three mistakes**, the game delivers a **jumpscare**.
- If the player succeeds, the nightmare **fades**, creating a strong sense of relief.
