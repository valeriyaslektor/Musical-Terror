# 🎮 10 Minutes of Gameplay: Musical Terror

## **Day 1**

The protagonist wakes up, sees the ceiling, gets up, and looks around the room. The player presses the left arrow key to move to another room. In front of them is a piano. When the player interacts with it, the camera switches to a first-person view – at the bottom, the piano keys are visible, and above them, falling blocks indicating the notes. Pressing any key starts the game.

The blocks begin to fall. The player tries to understand the mechanics – they must press the correct keys at the right time to ensure the notes land on the designated field. 

After **20 seconds**, the piano screen **suddenly disappears**. A **loud knocking sound** is heard. The screen transitions back to the room, but now a **girl** is present. She is looking at the protagonist. 

A dialogue box appears:  

**“Darkmoor, hey! Sorry, I was passing by and thought I’d drop in. By the way, I bought some amazing lime-flavored chips! I know how much you love them!”** (an icon of chips appears on the piano). The protagonist remains seated.  

**“I was thinking, maybe we could go to the movies? *Sleep Paralysis 5* just came out!”**  

A new dialogue box appears:  

**Thoughts:** *“I haven’t seen the previous parts, and honestly, I never wanted to. Maybe I should ask to go another time? I have too much work.”*  

The player is given a choice:  

- **“Yes, of course, let’s go now. I’m already done.”** (*+1 to good ending*)  
- **“Maybe another time?”** (*+1 to bad ending*)  

If the player **agrees**, an image of a cinema appears. Then, the protagonist returns home and goes to sleep.  

If the player **refuses**, the piano gameplay continues for another **30 seconds** until the melody ends. The protagonist then transitions to the bedroom and goes to sleep.

## **Day 2**

The protagonist wakes up again. They sit at the piano and begin playing. This time, the melody is **different, slightly sadder**.  

Suddenly, there’s **knocking at the door again**. This time, it’s the **mailman**.  

A dialogue box appears:  

**“Hey, kid. I get that you’re busy, but could you finally start picking up your own mail? Your mailbox is overflowing, and I’ve got nowhere to put the new letters!”**  

Another dialogue box follows:  

**Thoughts:** *“Oh God, he’s so annoying. Maybe I should coat the doorknob with rat poison next time? Anyway, time to get back to the piano—I don’t have time for this.”*  

The player is given a choice:  

- **“Everything’s fine. Thanks for the letter. Goodbye.”** (*+1 to bad ending*)  
- **“Alright, fine. Next time, I’ll pick up the mail myself.”** (*+1 to good ending*)  

The mailman leaves. The protagonist continues playing the rest of the melody.  

### **Night: Sleep Paralysis**

The protagonist goes to bed again. Suddenly, **their breathing becomes heavy**. Their **eyes open** to see **horrifying creatures looming over them**. These monsters seem to be **woven from shadows**, their **hungry eyes staring**, emitting **horrifying sounds**, like grinding metal.  

The **interface appears on the screen**:  
- **Top right corner:** A **timer** (1 minute).  
- **Bottom:** Piano keys.  
- **Above:** Blocks with notes, ready to fall.  

The player presses a key, and the **music begins**. The timer counts down. The demons **disturb** the player with **loud noises** to disrupt their rhythm. As the timer approaches **zero**, the player successfully plays all the notes.  

The **keys and notes disappear**. The **demons remain**, staring for a moment before vanishing. **Dawn breaks.** The **first sleep paralysis has been conquered**.  

If the player **makes three mistakes** while playing, the demons **immediately attack** (a **jumpscare appears**). **Game over.** The level restarts.  

As the game progresses:  
- The **falling blocks speed up**.  
- The **demons' noise gets louder**.  
- The **melodies become longer and more complex**.
