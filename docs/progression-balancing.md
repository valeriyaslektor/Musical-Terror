# ðŸ“Š Progression System Balancing

## **Description**

The progression system consists of **main levels**, which are tied to the story, and **bonus levels**, which players can complete to gain additional advantages (**hearts** that allow survival after encountering a screamer).

Bonus levels are **optional** and add variability to the gameplay. Players can skip them but will not receive extra hearts.

## **Formulas**

### **Bonus Level Difficulty Calculation:**
Bonus level difficulty is determined as the **average** between the **previous and next** main level difficulties:

```
Bonus Difficulty = (Previous Main Level Difficulty + Next Main Level Difficulty) / 2
```

---

## **Justification for Bonus Level Dynamics**

### **Level Alternation:**
- Bonus levels provide a **mid-level challenge** and give players a **choice**: 
  - **Accept the challenge** for a **useful boost** (**hearts**).
  - **Skip the level** and continue the story.

### **Why Medium Difficulty for Bonus Levels?**
1. **Fairness:** Bonus levels are difficult enough to make the rewards feel **earned**, but not so hard that they become frustrating.
2. **Flexibility:** Players can either **play for extra boosts** or **skip to focus on the story**.

### **Player Choice & Flexibility:**
- Skipping **bonus levels** gives **freedom of choice**, preventing frustration.
- Players **who enjoy a harder challenge** and complete the game without **boosts** can receive a **high-rarity achievement in Steam**, motivating **hardcore players**.

---

## **Why This Balancing Approach?**
- Ensures **player engagement** without **breaking game flow**.
- **Bonus levels remain important**, but **optional**, allowing **players to set their own challenge level**.
